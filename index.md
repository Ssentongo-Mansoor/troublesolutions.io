## Welcome to Trouble Solutions

You can use the this platform (https://github.com/Ssentongo-Mansoor/troublesolutions.io//index.md) to write and post an incident post-mortem report for any problem that you have ever solved.

This is to ensure that everyone can learn from the committed mistakes. Mistakes are there for us to learn not to blame anyone

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ssentongo-Mansoor/troublesolutions.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
